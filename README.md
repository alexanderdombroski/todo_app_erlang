# Overview

This is a todolist task manager that fully developed in Erlang. It was developed using Erlang/OTP 26 \[erts-14.2.4\]. 

This is a simple ErLang project I used as an oppourtunity to learn the basic app template setup generated by "rebar3 new app *app_name*". 

It uses a supervisor and a gen_server, which is completely unnessary for this scale of a project, but the experience will help with future ErLang projects.
